Version 0.9

* New interface 
	For better usability especially on small height resolution screens :
    - midi map, algorithm and bank boxes on left panel can be hidden.
    - vibrato and tremolo knobs moved in a popup dialog and are replaced with a LFO button.
    - Algorithm editor moved in a popup window.
	Optimized buttons shape.
	X and Y tick values on envelope graphs.
	Values on main volume and oscillators pan sliders.
* Run without GUI with --nogui option. Should reduce cpu load, specially on small machines.
* English and French language packets.
* Deep code reorganisation.
* New sound features :
    - filter (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-reject) with settings for main frequency and q factor and a frequency envelope.
    - oscillators frequencies vary from -48 to 48 semitones instead of -24 to 24.
    - each oscillator frequency can be absolute or note-related.
* Presets modifications are no longer lost when changing preset. User is prompted to save or not when leaving and can save at any time.
* New presets.
* New presets menu to import, export, reset, save modified presets and open presets folders.
* New install script.
* Lot of bugs fixed.
